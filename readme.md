### For the backend
AWS credentials need to be set up in AWS console
Serverless needs to configured with the AWS credentials
Dependencies for serverless need to be installed via package.json
Models need to be stored in s3 bucket
The code can be deployed using the 'sls deploy'
Docker needs to be running for deployment


### Data scripts
The data scripts used in Google colab for data preprocessing and  training of the model

### Demos
Has demo jupyter notebooks for both the models used in the application

### Frontend
Dependencies need to be installed via npm install
firebase and AWS API gateway endpoints need to be configured in environment file
